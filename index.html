										<h2>About Us</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This Mu Delta Chapter of Kappa Sigma is the longest standing fraternity on campus here 
									at the University of California, Irvine. As we celebrate 35 years of excellence, we proudly 
									advance a tradition of dominance and seek to further ourselves as a chapter, as brothers, 
									and individually as gentlemen. In addition to being the premiere social presence 
									here at UCI, we routinely produce scholars, athletes, and leaders – men of the highest 
									caliber. Furthermore, Kappa Sigma is notably committed to positively impacting both UCI 
									and the surrounding community through service and our various philanthropies.</p>

										<h2>Mission</h2>
									</header>
									<h4>Fellowship</h4>
									<p>Kappa Sigma is one of only four fraternities to have a house on campus. Our house 
									is where we hold weekly chapter meeting and discuss private chapter business.</p>
									<h4>Leadership</h4>
									<p>Men are called to lead. From the moment a Kappa Sigma pledge is chosen to the 
									day of his graduation, every brother is being groomed to take upon himself 
									the mantle of leadership and a greater responsibility. We are taught to 
									always take the initiative and above all else, be steadfast and to never be 
									led astray from an objective nor compromise the integrity of character based 
									upon another’s words. As an assembly of leaders, Kappa Sigma boasts impressive 
									campus involvement and a strong presence at the university.</p>
									<h4>Scholarship</h4>
									<p>Kappa Sigma understands that it is your first and foremost responsibility to 
									receive your education and strive in academic endeavors. We aim to help brothers 
									prepare themselves for their professional career, and with such a vast alumni 
									involvement and network, the tools are set for success.​</p>
									<h4>Service</h4>
									<p>Great men lead by example. The University of California, Irvine and Kappa 
									Sigma Nationals annually recognizes this Mu-Delta chapter of Kappa Sigma for 
									its dedication to service. We take pride in our diversity as a chapter, and 
									as a result support each brother in his individual philanthropic interests. 
									Consequently, we have developed and continued to maintain strong ties with 
									various organizations, from the LAPD to Nike, as we strive to better our 
									surroundings and to help those unable to do the same. We take our 
									philanthropic efforts seriously, both as a means to (in all humility) 
									“give back” to the community and to better ourselves as gentlemen.</p>

					<div class="12u"><span class="image right"><img src="images/social.jpg" alt="" /></span>Your college experience can either be one dismissed, or 
					among the most significant and electric moments of your life. Kappa Sigma 
					has the most ambitious and relentless social calendar of any fraternity on 
					campus; ask around, our reputation speaks for itself. We maintain 
					excellent relations with all sororities on campus and are extremely well 
					known for our incredible, and routinely held, sorority exchanges. Words 
					fail to describe our venue parties; the only appropriate ones are inappropriate for this description. 
					Regardless, the biggest venue party of the year, Bright N' Tight, makes it 
					quite obvious why our social presence is unmatched, featuring the likes of Slander, 
					NGHTMRE, Elephante, and Griffin Stoller. Dynasty Days, our formal 
					hosted in Las Vegas, also sets us apart. To top it all off, our SWAT-sponsored Lake Havasu trip
					is like no other held at UCI; it’s easy to see why Kappa Sigma is the undisputed social juggernaut here at UCI.
